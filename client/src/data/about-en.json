  "journeyText": "I love learning and making whatever I feel like on the computer. The most important thing that I've realized through living is the fact that there's no perfect anything but through collaboration and open communication, figuring out an optimal solution for all is possible. This extends to how I view user experience especially. On top of all that, I do find that most importantly, not understanding where to start, although scary, is only a natural part of the process for everything great to happen!",
